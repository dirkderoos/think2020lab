The Cobweb Palace was a popular saloon and restaurant at Meiggs Wharf in San Francisco, California during and after the Gold Rush. It was run by eccentric "Old Abe" Warner, who traded drinks for exotic pets, curios, and pieces of scrimshaw as well as money. An old, crippled sailor sold peanuts outside. The Palace was popular with seafarers, tourists, and locals alike. Old Abe's menu included free chowder, seafood, alcohol, and local French bread, but not whisky, which he thought of as lesser. There was a shooting gallery, and the bar was a few steps below the sidewalk.Mark Twain may have visited the place.
