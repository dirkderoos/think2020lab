Stonestown Galleria is a shopping mall in San Francisco, California. It features Target. Its former anchor stores are Macy's and Nordstrom. It is located immediately north of San Francisco State University and near Mercy High School and Lowell High School.
The anchor stores are each two stories, but most in-line stores are one story. The hallways form a plus shape, with the former Macy's on the north side, and Target,   former Nordstrom, Trader Joe's, Chase, Olive Garden, and Bank of America, on the south side. There are four wings, two on level one and two on level two. A food court is on the second story. There are some skylights in the mall. Marble columns adorn the center court. A demolition/rebuilding project in the late 1980s added many of the current architectural features.
