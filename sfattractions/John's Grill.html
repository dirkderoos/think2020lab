John's Grill is a historic restaurant in San Francisco, California at 63 Ellis Street. The restaurant is famous, in part, thanks to the novel The Maltese Falcon.  On the climactic final night of the novel's plot, detective Sam Spade dines on chops, potatoes, and tomato at John's Grill after coming into possession of the falcon.
