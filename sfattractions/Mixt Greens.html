MIXT (previously Mixt Greens) is a fast-casual restaurant that specializes in chef-crafted salads, grain bowls, market plates and sandwiches sourced from better ingredients (local, organic, sustainable, artisan). The company was founded in 2005 in San Francisco by Andrew Swallow, a fine dining chef and cookbook author, his sister Leslie Silverglide, an entrepreneur with a masters degree in sustainability; and her husband David Silverglide, a technology executive.In 2009, MIXT was acquired by an international private equity firm Inventages, a life-sciences, nutrition and wellness-focused venture capital fund formed with the support of Nestle. In 2012, the company was re-acquired by founders, David and Leslie Silverglide, with plans to expand the concept nationwide and broaden the menu into a variety of healthy options designed to make eating better more modern and accessible. in 2016, the company re-named the concept 'MIXT,' dropping the 'Greens'. As of 2020, MIXT operates 16 locations across California, Arizona, and Texas.MIXT focuses on sourcing as many organic, sustainable, and local ingredients as possible and crafting the most delicious combinations with fresh ingredients so that eating better is effortless. In 2006, the first location served more than 55,000 pounds of organic lettuce. Environmental initiatives have included the installation of edible walls at the restaurants that grow a mix of lettuce and herbs in-house for use in the company's food, pioneering the use of compostable packaging for its take-away products, and composting or recycling over 90% of the restaurants' daily waste.  In 2018, MIXT became a Certified B Corporation, to provide further transparency into its environmental and social impact practices.
