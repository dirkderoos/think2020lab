Boudin Bakery is a bakery based in San Francisco, California, known for its sourdough bread (trademarked as "The Original San Francisco Sourdough"). It was established in 1849 by Isidore Boudin, son of a family of master bakers from Burgundy, France, by blending the sourdough prevalent among miners in the Gold Rush with French techniques. The Boudin Bakery is San Francisco's oldest continuously operating business.Steven Giraudo, an artisan baker from Italy whose first job in America was at Boudin, bought the bakery in 1941 but later sold it in 1993 after Boudin became the cornerstone of the San Francisco Frenchbread Company. After a series of ownership changes the bakery was reacquired by Steven Giraudo's grandson, Daniel in 2002. Under Daniel's leadership Boudin's products are available globally through retailers such as Costco, Safeway and other grocery retailers.The bakery has locations on Fisherman's Wharf near San Francisco Bay, Disney California Adventure Park, and 30 other cafes scattered throughout California.  The main bakery in San Francisco is in the Richmond District on the corner of 10th Avenue and Geary Boulevard. The Boudin Bakery hosts the attraction "The Bakery Tour" at Disney California Adventure, where tourists are given a tour about how sourdough bread is produced. The bakery still uses the same starter yeast-bacteria culture it developed during the California Gold Rush.The first outlet outside California was established in 1979 in the Yorktown Center mall in Lombard, Illinois. It was  closed in mid-2009.
