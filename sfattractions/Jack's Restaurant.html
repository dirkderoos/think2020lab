Jack's Restaurant was a restaurant in San Francisco, California. Opened in 1863, Jack's was the second oldest restaurant in the city, following Tadich Grill.It was made a San Francisco Designated Landmark in 1981.
In 2002, French-born chef Philippe Jeanty purchased Jack's, later renaming it Jeanty on Jack's, and operated it as a brasserie, until it abruptly closed in May 2009.
In June 2016, Bar Works purchased the freehold to the 6,000 sq ft building for a reported $3.55 million. The former restaurant is set to become a co-working space, with food and a bar.
