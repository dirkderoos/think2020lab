Grace Cathedral is an Episcopal cathedral on Nob Hill, San Francisco, California. It is the cathedral church  of the Episcopal Diocese of California.
The cathedral is famed for its mosaics by Jan Henryk De Rosen, a replica of Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise, two labyrinths, varied stained glass windows, Keith Haring AIDS Chapel altarpiece, and medieval and contemporary furnishings, as well as its forty-four bell carillon, three organs, and choirs.
The cathedral has one of only a handful of remaining Episcopal men and boys cathedral choirs, the Grace Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys; the 24 boys of the choir attend the Cathedral School for Boys, while the 12 men are a professional ensemble.  There is also a mixed-voice adult choir.  The director of music and choirmaster is Ben Bachmann.
