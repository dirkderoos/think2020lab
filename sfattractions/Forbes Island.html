Forbes Island, now closed, was a restaurant between Pier 39 and Pier 41 in Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, United States. It has been temporarily moved to Holland Riverside Marina in Brentwood, California. It was the only "floating island" restaurant in the Bay Area. The restaurant was inspired by Captain Nemo's marine dwelling.
