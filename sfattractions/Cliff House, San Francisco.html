<body>
The Cliff House is a restaurant on Point Lobos Avenue perched on the headland above the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach, in the Outer Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco, California. It has had six major incarnations since its beginnings in 1858, the most recent being a 2003 restoration to the general appearance of the fourth. It overlooks the site of the former Sutro Baths and is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, operated by the National Park Service. Its terrace hosts a room-sized camera obscura.
Dozens of ships have run aground on the southern shore of the Golden Gate below the Cliff House.
