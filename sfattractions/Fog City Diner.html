Fog City, previously known as the Fog City Diner, is a San Francisco, California, landmark. Located at 1300 Battery Street just off The Embarcadero near the Filbert Steps, the diner was a popular tourist attraction, as well as an occasional movie location. (Among other productions, it was used in So I Married an Axe Murderer with Mike Myers and an episode of Nash Bridges, starring Don Johnson.)  
The decor of the diner was styled as 1930s nostalgia, with stainless steel, checkered tile, and other typical diner accoutrements of that era, although the cuisine was modern. 
The diner closed on March 15, 2013 and reopened later that year as Fog City.
