Brasserie Saint James is a brewpub in Reno, Nevada. The restaurant opened to the public on October 17, 2012 on the site of an old icehouse with its own water supply. Over one hundred emptied wine barrels are kept for maturing their beers. The brewery acquired space in San Francisco's Mission District for a second location in 2015, which opened the following year.
