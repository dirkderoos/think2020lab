Bernal Heights Summit or Bernal Heights Hill is a hill in the San Francisco, California neighborhood of Bernal Heights. Upper elevations are part of Bernal Hill Park, a component of San Francisco Recreation and Parks. At the highest elevation is a privately owned site, which contains an equipment building and 50-foot tall telecommunications tower, which is currently unnamed. The park and summit are largely surrounded by Bernal Heights Boulevard.
